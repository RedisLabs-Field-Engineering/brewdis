== Architecture

image::app/brewdis-architecture.png[Brewdis]

Brewdis consumes inventory demand events from Kafka and publishes inventory updates to Kafka using the Redis Kafka Connector.

Inventory state is maintained in real-time by Redis in the `inventory` index.

Product catalog and inventory can be queried in RediSearch directly or in Tableau via the https://github.com/redis-field-engineering/redis-sql[Trino integration].
